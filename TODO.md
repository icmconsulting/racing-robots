# TODO

## Test Harness
- Add other bots 

## Game viewer / Game
- Ensure cards selected by user are from the cards they were dealt - if caught cheating, destroy robot on first register
    - Only randomly detect cheaters - only catch 1 in every 3 or so
- Use consistent board square pieces (the ones that match the bots)
- Incrementally show result after each register

- Viewable player archive marker
- show game id
- Bots destroyed -> explosion sprite

## Boards
- Add new boards

## Tournament
