# TODO

## Test Harness
- Make log messages human readable
    - toggle button on control box

- Transit?

## Game viewer / Game
- No response received/invalid response received handling - deal 2 damage
- Lambda use bonus application
- Everytime player sleeps, chances of spontaneous combustion doubles - to prevent chronic sleepers
- Use consistent board square pieces (the ones that match the bots)
- Incrementally show result after each register
- Viewable player archive marker
- Ensure cards selected by user are from the cards they were dealt - if caught cheating, destroy robot on first register
    - Only randomly detect cheaters - only catch 1 in every 3 or so
- show game id
- Bots destroyed -> explosion sprite

## Boards
- Add new boards
