# Differences in RR from Robot Rally

* No option cards
* All players have 5s to respond - if no response, then 5 damage penalty will be applied
* Invalid response for turn messages will incur a 5 damage penalty. Invalid responses can result in unpredictable behaviour!
** Invalid response during clean-up phase will assume no-action response
* No choice in square and direction if landing on archive marker with other robot - randomly selected
* Order of robots being placed onto conflicting archive marker after being destroyed is by starting order (not by order of being destroyed)
* No choice in direction after being destroyed and respawned
* After destroyed, can't take any more damage - just removed from the board
* No pusher squares(?)
* If powered down, can only be choose to continue to be powered down during clean up phase
* A draw occurs if:
    - The last robots alive are destroyed on the same turn AND have both reached the same number of flags
