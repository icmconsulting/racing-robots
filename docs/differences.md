# Differences in RR from Robot Rally

* No option cards
* The last player to respond to turn will have 2 seconds to respond, or else will time out (vs. 30s)
* No choice in square and direction if landing on archive marker with other robot - randomly selected
* No choice in direction after being destroyed and respawned
* After destroyed, can't take any more damage - just removed from the board
* No pusher squares(?)
* If powered down, can only be choose to continue to be powered down during clean up phase
